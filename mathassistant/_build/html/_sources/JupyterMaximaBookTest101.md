Jupyter And Maxima
=======================

This is an example of a jupyter notebook that connects directly to the Maxima CAS. 
You can directly interact with maxima from within jupyter, instead of using an indirect interface.
This is not as versatile as SageMath but doesn't load your cpu down either.
